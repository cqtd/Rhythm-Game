# Rhythm Game Base

### Description

This repository provides a simplified game template with music. Also, the project is being developed under Unity 2020.2 and `URP`.  
  
I referred to UX of `DJMAX Respect V` which is my favorite game. I have enjoyed the game since it was released on the `PSP` Platform. Moreover, this repository is **not designed for commercial** purposes. I made these just because I wanted to expand my experience in Unity by reconstructing the `DJMAX` with respect to developers as an old fan of this game.  
  
First of all, BMS was chosen as the basis for this project. This is because it is easy to prototype using the already existing BMS package without producing new music and note sheet. In the future, I'm planning to serialize the data about the song in my own format.

### Roadmap

* BMS Parser
* BMS Editor
* BMS Auto Generator
